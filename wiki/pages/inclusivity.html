  <h1> Inclusivity Tool </h1>

  <h2> What is Accessibility and Why is it Important? </h2>
  <p> Let's first explore what accessibility means and why it's crucial. Imagine being a person with low vision,
    dyslexia, or even a member of the aging population. As people age, they may experience declines in vision, hearing,
    and cognitive functions. Websites that don't account for these changes can become increasingly difficult to use for
    those with disabilities. For instance, if a website lacks proper structure and alt tags, screen readers might miss
    important information, creating barriers between individuals with visual impairments and those who aren't affected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can fully engage with the
    digital world. For many individuals with disabilities, daily activities can become daunting, especially when
    encountering websites or applications that are not designed with accessibility in mind. That's why we’ve developed
    the Inclusivity Tool. This comprehensive JavaScript plugin improves the accessibility of websites by offering a
    variety of features tailored to users with specific needs. It can be easily embedded in any website, enhancing the
    user experience for individuals with low vision, dyslexia, ADHD, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding Disabilities</h2>
  <p>As we had used many disabilities terms and to understand the importance of accessibility better, let's briefly
    discuss some common disabilities:</p>

  <h3>Dyslexia</h3>
  <p>Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that affects reading and language processing. Individuals with dyslexia
    often struggle with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reading Fluency:</strong> Difficulty reading smoothly and at a normal pace.</li>
    <li><strong>Word Recognition:</strong> Trouble recognizing words automatically and accurately.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Accessible features like dyslexia-friendly fonts and simplified layouts can greatly enhance their reading
    experience.</p>

  <h3>Low Vision</h3>
  <p>Low vision refers to a significant visual impairment that cannot be corrected with standard glasses, contact
    lenses, or medical treatment. Common characteristics include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blurred Vision:</strong> Difficulty seeing fine details.</li>
    <li><strong>Blind Spots:</strong> Areas of vision loss that may hinder peripheral vision.</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitivity to Light:</strong> Increased discomfort in bright environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals with low vision may require larger text, high-contrast colors, or magnification tools to navigate
    digital content effectively.</p>

  <h3>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h3>
  <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and
    impulsiveness. Symptoms may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Trouble focusing, staying on task, or following through on instructions.</li>
    <li><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Excessive movement and difficulty remaining still.</li>
    <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Making hasty decisions without considering the consequences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals with ADHD may benefit from features that reduce distractions, such as “Read-Focus” tools that highlight
    content and dim surrounding areas.</p>

  <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
  <p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the
    brain. Seizures can vary in severity and may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Generalized Seizures:</strong> Affecting both sides of the brain, leading to loss of consciousness or
      convulsions.</li>
    <li><strong>Focal Seizures:</strong> Starting in one area of the brain, possibly causing unusual sensations or
      behaviors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy can be triggered by flashing lights or rapid visual changes, making it
    essential for websites to avoid such elements. High-contrast themes and simple color palettes can help reduce risks
    for these users.</p>

  <h3>Color Blindness</h3>
  <p>Color blindness is a visual impairment that affects the perception of colors. The most common forms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Protanopia:</strong> Inability to perceive red light.</li>
    <li><strong>Deuteranopia:</strong> Difficulty distinguishing green light.</li>
    <li><strong>Tritanopia:</strong> Inability to see blue light.</li>
    <li><strong>Achromatopsia:</strong> Inability to see any color, resulting in grayscale vision.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Individuals with color blindness may confuse certain colors and rely on contrast and brightness to differentiate
    elements. Designing websites with sufficient contrast and using patterns or text labels can improve accessibility
    for those with color blindness.</p>

  <h2>How the Inclusivity Tool Helps Everyone</h2>
  <p>The Inclusivity Tool is designed to enhance accessibility across websites, benefiting everyone involved. Here’s how
    it can help:</p>

    To reach different age groups effectively, we tailored our programs to suit
    their learning needs. For high school students (classes 9 through 12), we
    organized two sessions called "Beyond the Microscopes," offered both online
    and offline. These sessions were designed to move beyond conventional textbook
    teaching, introducing students to real-world applications of synthetic biology
    and computational biology. We emphasized hands-on learning, helping students
    visualize DNA and protein structures through tools like PyMOL, computational
    tools to translate DNA fragments.

  <p>
    For college students, we took a different approach by hosting a Tech-Bio
    Ideathon." This event encouraged participants to think critically and come up
    with innovative solutions to problems in synthetic biology. It was an
    opportunity for students to apply what they had learned in a creative,
    collaborative environment, connecting biology with real-world challenges. The
    judges for this ideathon were people from across industries and academia
    including professors, entrepreneurs, PhD students, doctors etc. We had maximum
    participation by women showcasing their growing interest in STEM. By fostering
    a space for innovative thinking, we aimed to empower college students to
    explore synthetic biology in a way that could lead to tangible contributions
    in the field.
