  <p>Our team is dedicated to advancing the field of synthetic biology and supporting fellow iGEMers through innovative
    tools and resources. Below are the key contributions we are proud to offer to the iGEM community and the scientific
    community at large:</p>
  <h1>IMPROVISeD</h1>
  <p>The IMPROVISeD (Integrated Modelling of PROtein complexes Via Single-shot registration using DREAM) tool is
    designed to assist researchers in the accurate modeling of protein complexes. By utilizing experimental data such as
    cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XLMS), IMPROVISeD provides distance restraints
    for building more precise structural models of proteins.</p>
  <p>This tool is particularly valuable for fellow iGEM teams and the broader scientific community, as it enables
    targeted therapeutic development by enhancing our understanding of protein interactions and functions. By providing
    access to a sophisticated modeling platform, we hope to empower researchers to leverage this technology in their own
    projects, fostering collaborative innovation in synthetic biology.</p>
  <h1>BEPT</h1>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5346/contributions/bept.png" alt="Figure has not downloaded">
    <figcaption>BEPT</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In today’s research landscape, many scientists encounter challenges when utilizing software tools available on
    platforms like GitHub, often due to unfamiliarity with the command line or difficulty in comprehending
    documentation. To address this gap, we developed BEPT (Bioinformatics Environment for Protein Tools), an interactive
    command line interface that simplifies the use of APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) for protein
    electrostatics studies.</p>
  <p>BEPT automates the generation of pdb2pqr commands and allows users to adjust APBS calculation parameters
    effortlessly. By recreating the functionality of the APBS web server within the terminal, BEPT provides a
    user-friendly design that helps researchers overcome initial apprehensions about command-line tools. Our
    contribution aims to make protein electrostatics more accessible, enabling scientists to conduct meaningful research
    without the barriers often associated with traditional command-line interfaces. </p>
  <h1>Inclusivity Tool for Enhanced Accessibility</h1>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5346/contributions/inclusivity.png" alt="Figure has not downloaded">
    <figcaption>Inclusivity</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Understanding the importance of inclusivity in research and education, we are developing a plug-in tool designed to
    enhance accessibility on our web platform. This tool features options for color customization to aid colorblind
    individuals, a reading focus option for those with attention disorders, and text customization for improved
    readability. Additionally, it highlights links and buttons on the webpage to ensure that all users can navigate our
    resources effectively.</p>
  <p>By prioritizing inclusivity, we aim to create an environment where every individual, regardless of their abilities
    or challenges, can engage with our project and the broader field of synthetic biology. This plug-in tool can be
    utilised by iGEMers to enhance accessibility and inclusivity on their wikis. </p>
  <h1>SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY IDEATHON FRAMEWORK</h1>
  <p>To assist upcoming iGEM teams in organizing effective ideathons, we designed a systematic workflow that can be used
    to make these events both informative and impactful. This framework aims to help future teams expand their reach,
    engage their audience, and communicate ideas effectively through structured ideation sessions. The workflow
    emphasizes the importance of clear objectives, well-defined challenges, audience targeting, and providing
    participants with the right tools, resources, and mentorship to foster creative thinking and problem-solving. By
    following this process, iGEM teams can host ideathons that inspire innovative ideas and drive meaningful discussions
    in synthetic biology and related fields.</p>
