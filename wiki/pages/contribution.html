  <p>Our team is dedicated to advancing the field of synthetic biology and supporting fellow iGEMers through innovative
    tools and resources. Below are the key contributions we are proud to offer to the iGEM community and the scientific
    community at large.</p>
  <h1>IMPROViSeD</h1>
  <p>IMPROViSeD is a cutting-edge, robust, scalable, and efficient tool specifically designed to model protein complexes using experimentally 
    derived geometric constraints. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on computational predictions, IMPROViSeD integrates actual experimental 
    data to deliver precise and accurate structural models of protein complexes. This data-driven approach ensures that the models reflect 
    the real-world dynamics of protein interactions, which is crucial for understanding biological mechanisms at a molecular level.</p>

    <p>For iGEMers, the power of IMPROViSeD lies in its ability to aid in visualisation and thereby accelerate the development of targeted 
      therapeutics. 
      By elucidating the precise structure of protein complexes, such as those involved in cancer metastasis (as we have),
      teams can design more effective drugs and therapies that target specific protein-protein interactions with higher precision. 
      The platform's scalability ensures that even large, multi-subunit complexes can be modelled efficiently, making it an 
      invaluable resource for synthetic biology projects that require detailed molecular insights.</p>
    
    <p>Whether it's designing antibodies, inhibitors, or other therapeutic molecules, IMPROViSeD empowers iGEM teams to 
      bridge the gap between structural biology and clinical applications, opening new possibilities for developing next-generation 
      treatments for complex diseases. </p>

  <p>In today's research landscape, many scientists encounter challenges when utilizing software tools available on
    platforms like GitHub, often due to unfamiliarity with the command line or difficulty in comprehending
    documentation. To address this gap, we developed BEPT (Bioinformatics Environment for Protein Tools), an interactive
    command line interface that simplifies the use of APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) for protein
    electrostatics studies.</p>
  <p>BEPT automates the generation of pdb2pqr commands and allows users to adjust APBS calculation parameters
    effortlessly. By recreating the functionality of the APBS web server within the terminal, BEPT provides a
    user-friendly design that helps researchers overcome initial apprehensions about command-line tools. Our
    contribution aims to make protein electrostatics more accessible, enabling scientists to conduct meaningful research
    without the barriers often associated with traditional command-line interfaces.</p>

  Bept also provides a framework for the iGEM community for building their interactive command line tool in Python.
  <ol>
    <li><b>Define Scope</b>  
      <p>
        Outline the tool's goals, core functionalities, and supported techniques (e.g., protein analysis, electrostatics). Bept has a well defined scope for protein electrostatics studies clearly defined in the documentation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Use Beginner-Friendly Libraries</b>  
      <p>
        Leverage python libraries like `click` or `argparse` for CLI and `rich` for interactive output, ensuring ease of use. Grouping commands logically, providing clear help descriptions, and including simple examples helps users understand the tool's capabilities. Bept uses `click`, `rich`, `beaupy`, `textual` and more libraries for interactive interfaces.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Testing and Maintainance</b>  
      <p>
        Implement unit tests, integration tests, and continuous integration to ensure the tool's reliability and performance. Regular updates and bug fixes enhance the user experience. Bept has been tested cross-platform on Linux, MacOS and Windows and well maintained on Github.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Documentation</b>
      <p>
        Create detailed documentation with installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips to guide users effectively. You can add the documentation online using Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, or other platforms. Bept uses Sphinx and Read the Docs for documentation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Publishing on Package Managers</b>
      <p>
        Distribute the tool on PyPI, Conda, Homebrew, etc. for easy installation and accessibility. Include versioning and dependencies for seamless integration.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  Bept is available on <a href="https://github.com/IISc-Software-iGEM/bept">Github</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bept/">PyPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AnirudhG07/homebrew-AnirudhG07">Homebrew Tap</a>.

  <h1>Inclusivity Tool for Enhanced Accessibility</h1>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5346/contributions/inclusivity.png" alt="inclusivity image">
    <figcaption>Inclusivity</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Understanding the importance of inclusivity in research and education, we have developed a plug-in tool designed to
    enhance accessibility on our web platform. This tool features options for color customization to aid colorblind
    individuals, a reading focus option for those with attention disorders, and text customization for improved
    readability. Additionally, it highlights links and buttons on the webpage to ensure that all users can navigate our
    resources effectively.</p>
  <p>By prioritizing inclusivity, we aim to create an environment where every individual, regardless of their abilities
    or challenges, can engage with our project and the broader field of synthetic biology. This plug-in tool can be
    utilised by iGEMers to enhance accessibility and inclusivity on their wikis. </p>

  <h1>Synthetic Biology Ideathon Framework</h1>
  <p>To assist upcoming iGEM teams in organizing effective ideathons, we designed a systematic workflow that can be used
    to make these events both informative and impactful. This framework aims to help future teams expand their reach,
    engage their audience, and communicate ideas effectively through structured ideation sessions. The workflow
    emphasizes the importance of clear objectives, well-defined challenges, audience targeting, and providing
    participants with the right tools, resources, and mentorship to foster creative thinking and problem-solving. By
    following this process, iGEM teams can host ideathons that inspire innovative ideas and drive meaningful discussions
    in synthetic biology and related fields.</p>
