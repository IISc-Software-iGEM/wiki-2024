                <h2>Background</h2>
                <br>
                <p> The Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) designed to determine macromolecular assemblies.     Using Bayesian inference, IMP models
                    biomolecular systems ranging from small peptides to large macromolecular complexes
                    by integrating data from experiments, statistical analyses, physical principles, and prior
                    models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    IMP frames the construction of structural models as a computational optimization
                    problem, where information about the assembly is encoded into a scoring function that
                    evaluates candidate models. These scoring functions comprise terms known as restraints,
                    which measure how well a model aligns with the information from which the restraint
                    was derived. The restraints incorporate both general structural knowledge and specific
                    details about the target structure. Consequently, a candidate model that scores well is
                    consistent with all available information. The precision and accuracy of the resulting
                    model improve with the amount and quality of information encoded in the restraints.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Integrative modeling facilitates the incorporation of new and varied information, lowering the barrier for using incremental data that is typically not applied to structural
                    characterization. Even when individual data types are relatively uninformative, the integration of multiple types can provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of an assembly.
                    This approach often results in more precise and complete models than those based on
                    single data sources.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, IMP offers a framework for both static and dynamic modeling, enhancing
                    its utility across a range of biomolecular systems.</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <br>
                <p>IMP is a powerful tool for modeling macromolecular assemblies, but several challenges
                    must be addressed to enhance its accuracy and its applications. These challenges
                    include optimizing model representation, expanding the variety of computable models,
                    and incorporating diverse types of data. Additionally, there is a need for improved
                    methods to score models, sample models, and analyze and interpret results.
                    Currently, IMP employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the
                    space of possible models, which can be computationally expensive and slow. To address
                    this, we propose developing an IMP-based software tool that models the structure of
                    macromolecular assemblies using a bottom-up approach.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our approach will utilize the Distance Restraint and Energy Assisted Modeling (DREAM)
                    algorithm, a novel method for modeling the structure of macromolecular assemblies. This
                    algorithm follows a bottom-up strategy, building smaller substructures for regions with
                    a high concentration of experimental data and consolidating them before modeling the
                    rest of the structure. This method improves structure conformance in
                    the final models, with experimental data. It provides a faster and
                    scalable approach to modeling macromolecular assemblies by using a single-step assembly
                    of complexes, as opposed to the conventional iterative assembly.

                <br>
                <p>Proteins are the driving forces behind cellular processes, participating in various biological
                    functions such as signal transduction, gene regulation, and cell division. They do not act
                    in isolation but collaborate with other proteins to form macromolecular assemblies. These
                    assemblies are crucial for the cell’s proper functioning, performing complex tasks that no
                    single protein can accomplish alone. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these
                    assemblies is key to comprehending biological systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, the inability to determine the structure of macromolecular assemblies has
                    been a significant obstacle in structural biology. Initially, NMR problems were addressed
                    using distance geometry, but its lack of scalability limited its utility. This led to a focus on
                    molecular dynamics, MCMC, and other methods, which are computationally intensive.
                    Modeling the structure and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies can provide in
                    sights into the workings, evolution, control, and design of biological systems. Our iGEM
                    project aims to use Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) with the DREAM algorithm
                    to build models of macromolecular assemblies using a bottom-up approach, overcoming
                    existing bottlenecks.</p>
