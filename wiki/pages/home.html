      I'm your partner in crime! I trap iron-loving molecules and help you stay
      active. When we team up, we can break through any barrier. But when we're
      unchecked, we contribute to something serious — cancer spread.

  <h1>Why Modeling Protein Complexes Matters</h1>
  <p>
    Biological functions depend on interactions between proteins, forming
    complexes that serve essential roles in cellular activities like signaling,
    transport, and metabolism. However, when these complexes misassemble, it can
    lead to severe conditions, including cancer. Traditional methods of modeling
    protein complexes rely on predictions or slow trial-and-error simulations,
    which often lack accuracy.
  </p>
  <p>
    To pave the way for more effective therapies, we need to see the
    interactions at a molecular level, and that's where <b>IMPROViSeD</b> steps in. Our
    platform integrates data from multiple experimental methods to create
    accurate, scalable models.
  </p>

<div class="col-12 content card">
  <h1>The IMPROViSeD Advantage</h1>
  <p>IMPROViSeD introduces a one-shot registration approach for protein complex modeling that revolutionizes the process by utilizing distance restraints derived directly from experimental data such as cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, AFM, XLMS, and NMR. Unlike traditional methods that rely on random sampling and prediction-heavy algorithms, IMPROViSeD uses DREAM (Distance Restraints and Energy Assisted Modeling) to efficiently map out protein substructures with minimal computational overhead.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fast.</b>No Monte Carlo or Bayesian inference. Skips exhaustive, random sampling of possible configurations.</li>
      <li><b>Data-Driven.</b>Provides a more reliable and accurate model using experimental data.</li>
      <li><b>Scalable.</b>Suitable for modeling large and complex datasets with ease.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In comparison, traditional methods are time-consuming, prediction-based, and sampling-heavy. 
    </p>

<div class="col-12 content card">
  <h1>The Future of Disease Modeling</h1>
  <p>IMPROVISeD is not just a leap forward in protein complex modeling—it's a shift in how we think about biological research. With accurate, scalable models, scientists can better understand diseases like cancer and design innovative therapies that target the problem at its source.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a researcher looking to improve your understanding of protein structures, or you're interested in the therapeutic applications of this research, IMPROVISeD opens new avenues for exploration.</p>
