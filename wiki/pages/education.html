    <p class="text">We visited National Public School Rajajinagar to introduce high school students to synthetic biology and the
        role of computational tools in advancing the field. We began with an overview of DNA and proteins, followed
        by a hands-on DNA extraction experiment from papaya to reinforce their understanding. A quiz on molecular
        biology concepts further deepened their grasp of synthetic biology. We then demonstrated how scientists use
        software like PyMOL to visualize protein structures, DNA, and other biomolecules. Tailoring our explanations
        to a 10th-grade level, we discussed biomolecular segments and relevant biophysical concepts.

        Demonstration of DNA<br>
        During the DNA extraction, we showed the students a real DNA structure, 1BNA (1bna.pdb from the Protein Data Bank), which consists of a single DNA helix. We explained DNA’s structure, base pairs, and used PyMOL to visualize the chemical structure of the compound, helping them better understand DNA’s molecular composition.

        <br>
        Demonstration of Proteins<br>
        We introduced the students to protein structures, focusing on Keratin and Haemoglobin.
        <br>
        Keratin: We explained that Keratin is a structural protein found in hair, nails, and skin. We discussed how the structure of keratin differs in hair and nails, emphasizing the role of alpha-keratin in hair and beta-keratin in nails. We also addressed why vertical lines appear in nails, linking this to the arrangement of beta-keratin.
        <br>
        Haemoglobin: We explained that Haemoglobin is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. Using the 1a3n.pdb file, we showed its tetrameric structure, consisting of four subunits, and highlighted how iron in haemoglobin binds to oxygen. We also demonstrated how its structure changes when binding to oxygen and how it releases oxygen when reaching tissues. PyMOL helped illustrate the oxygen-binding sites, providing a clearer understanding of this crucial protein.
        <br>
        These demonstrations enhanced the students' understanding of common proteins in the body and the significance of molecular structures in synthetic biology.<br>
