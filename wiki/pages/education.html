<h1>AIIM</h1>
<h2>What is AIIM?</h2>
<p>
  The <b>All India iGEM Meet (AIIM)</b> is a premier annual event where iGEM
  teams from across India come together to exchange ideas, showcase innovations,
  and learn from each other. Hosted by a different team each year, AIIM fosters
  <b>collaboration</b> and knowledge-sharing, with the 2024 edition organized by
  the IISc Bangalore team. Alongside insightful talks by leading experts from
  <b>academia, industry, and entrepreneurship</b>, the meet offers an
  exceptional opportunity for teams to <b>connect</b> and grow. In 2024, the
  IISc-Software team led an exciting <b>workshop</b> on <b>"Computational Biology
    and Structural Visualization of Proteins,"</b> delving into specialized topics
  such as <b>protein electrostatics and statistical mechanics</b>. AIIM served
  as a dynamic platform for sparking new ideas, building networks, and deepening
  participants' understanding of these cutting-edge fields.
</p>

<h2>Workshop Summary</h2>
<p>
  The <b>primary goal</b> of this workshop was to share our knowledge on protein
  electrostatics and statistical mechanics—topics that are often unfamiliar to
  undergraduate students. Recognizing this gap, we aimed to provide a
  <b>comprehensive introduction</b> and offer valuable resources to help
  participants gain a deeper understanding of these advanced subjects. All the
  codes, and hands-on exercises were shared with the participants in the form of
  a github repository. The link to the website is
  <a
    href="https://github.com/IISc-Software-iGEM/Ion-Channel-NCC/tree/main/AIIM-Workshop"
    >here</a
  >.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Protein Structure Visualization with PyMol:</b>
    <p>
      We demonstrated some basics of <b>PyMol</b>, talked about commonly used
      file formats like <b>PDB</b> and <b>PQR</b>, alongside advanced features
      like alignment, morphing, and mutagenesis. The focus protein, NCC, was
      used to explain ion channels and their mutations, which cause the
      <b>Gitelman Syndrome</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Python Automation and APBS Electrostatics:</b>
    <p>
      We covered automating PyMol tasks using Python and introduced participants
      to the <b>APBS</b> command-line tools and web-server for calculating
      electrostatic potentials, making the topic more approachable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Statistical Mechanics for Molecular Dynamics:</b>
    <p>
      Here we shared an overview of molecular simulations, underlying
      algorithms, limitations in their biological applications, and best
      practices for conducting simulations. The goal of this presentation was to
      highlight the potential of these methods in <b>synthetic biology</b>.

<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>
  The workshop was well-received by a diverse audience, including students from
  other iGEM teams, IISc undergraduates, and MTech students from the CDS
  department. Participants praised the practical insights into APBS and
  molecular simulations, expressing interest in similar future sessions. iGEM
  teams from IISER TVM and IIT Bombay were particularly enthusiastic, with many
  eager to explore these advanced topics further.
</p>

<h2>Talk by Dr. Debnath Pal - Our Primary PI</h2>
<p>
  In the talk titled <b>"Snippets from Computing on COVID"</b>, Debnath sir delved into the critical role of computational biology in understanding the complexities of SARS-CoV-2, especially when experimental data and observations were conflicting during the pandemic. The central question addressed was, <b>"Why is SARS-CoV-2 so contagious?"</b> Drawing from previous experiments and ongoing research, sir explained how computational models have been essential in reconciling divergent findings from lab-based experiments. One key focus was the <b>infection initiation model</b>, which helps explain the virus's heightened transmissibility compared to other coronaviruses. Current results from computational studies have provided insights into the virus's mechanisms of infection, such as its efficient binding to host receptors, which underpins its contagiousness. The talk concluded by emphasizing how computational approaches continue to be <b>invaluable for filling gaps</b> where traditional experiments fall short, ultimately advancing our understanding of COVID-19.

<h1>School Visit to NPS Rajajinagar</h1>

<p>
  To teach high school students about synthetic and computational biology, we
  began by introducing DNA and proteins, giving them a solid foundational
  understanding. This was followed by a
  <b>hands-on DNA extraction experiment</b> using papaya, allowing students to
  reinforce their knowledge through practical experience. Next, we conducted a
  quiz on molecular biology concepts to deepen their comprehension of synthetic
  biology. Finally, we demonstrated how scientists use software like PyMOL to
  visualize protein structures and biomolecules, enhancing the students'
  understanding of computational biology.
</p>
<p>
  Our team <b>tailored</b> the explanations for the students at a 10th-grade
  level, ensuring that the material on key biomolecular segments and relevant
  biophysical concepts was understandable. We did this after consulting with
  <b>Mrs. Sushma Ravikiran</b>, a biology faculty member at
  <b>Carmel School</b>, to make sure the content was appropriate for their
  educational level.

<h2>Demonstration of DNA</h2>
<p>
  The students were highly responsive, showing genuine curiosity and asking many
  insightful questions about how and why things work in biology. They were
  especially fascinated by the revolutionary potential of
  <b>synthetic biology</b>, which sparked their interest in exploring more about
  the field.
</p>

<h2>Demonstration of Proteins</h2>
<p>
  Next, we introduced the students to protein structures, focusing on
  <b>Keratin</b> and <b>Haemoglobin</b>, two proteins that are familiar to the students.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Keratin</b>
    <p>
      We explained keratin as a structural protein found in hair, nails, and
      skin. The focus was on the difference between <b>alpha-keratin</b> in hair
      and <b>beta-keratin</b> in nails, linking the vertical lines in nails to
      the arrangement of beta-keratin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Haemoglobin</b>
    <p>
      We explored Haemoglobin's role in <b>oxygen transport</b> and used the
      <b>1a3n.pdb</b>
      file to visualize its tetrameric structure. Through PyMOL, we demonstrated
      how iron binds to oxygen and the structural changes during oxygen binding
      and release, giving students a clear view of this essential process.

<h1>Beyond The Microscope</h1>
<p>
  In September, our team, alongside volunteers from the foundations, conducted
  online and hybrid sessions for the <b>“Beyond The Microscope”</b> initiative
  for <b>grades 9th to 12th</b>. The hybrid session engaged students from
  <b>Madhya Pradesh</b> and <b>Ladakh</b>, with participants attending from
  their school computer labs during school hours. This included schools where
  access to cutting-edge educational resources is often limited. The online
  sessions took place in the evenings, allowing students to join from their
  laptops and phones.
</p>
<p>
  These sessions focused on key concepts related to the conversion of DNA to
  proteins and the visualization of common protein structures, such as keratin
  and Haemoglobin, using PyMOL. We incorporated hands-on activities to illustrate
  DNA-to-protein conversion through online web servers. The protein
  visualization provided students with a deeper understanding of how these
  structures function within the body.

  We organized an engaging online session for students in
  <b>grades 5th to 8th</b>, in collaboration with the
  <b>STEAM Vision Foundation</b>. The students were from schools across the
  country. This interactive session introduced young participants to the
  fundamentals of molecular biology and illustrated how these concepts are
  applied in synthetic biology. To enhance their experience, we incorporated fun
  <b>art and craft</b> activities that encouraged creativity and hands-on
  learning.

  In the sessions, we focussed on an introduction to the molecular biology of DNA and
  Proteins. This gave them a better understanding of the importance of DNA in
  heredity and Proteins in our body. Each participant received our made 
  <b>synthetic biology booklet and bookmarks</b> as a reward for their active
  involvement in the session. <b>Volunteers</b> from the <b>STEAM Vision Foundation</b>
  played a crucial role in facilitating the crafts and ensuring that all
  students were actively engaged throughout the event. The students actively
  participated in making the <b>DNA models</b> with pencils, colored sticks and
