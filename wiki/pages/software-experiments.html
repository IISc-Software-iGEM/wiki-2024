        We did our experiments on 2 cases, one case involves a protein with 2 chains and other case involves a protein
        with 3 chains. We have used experimental as well as synthetic generated crosslinks data to run our pipeline.
        Here are the sources of our data.
    </p>
    <h1>1DFJ Case</h1>
    <p>
        We have protein 1DFJ which has 2 chains as shown below. We also have experimental crosslink data available for
        this protein from IMP (Cite this link) <href>https://intact-portal.ebi.ac.uk/interaction/EBI-2623041</href>

    <h1>
        LCN2-MMP9 Case
    </h1>
    <p>
        MMP9 has 2 chains and LCN2 has 1 chain. We have taken these 2 proteins from RCSB PDB which are as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do not have experimental crosslinks data available between these 2 proteins. Hence we have generated
        synthetic crosslinks data between using the following algorithm.

    <h1>Running the pipeline</h1>

    <h2>
        Number of crosslinks:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1DFJ: 12 (experimental)</li>
        <li>LCN2-MMP9: 11 (synthetically generated)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        All vs Subset of Crosslinks
    </h2>
    <p>
        We run our pipeline by choosing random subsets of crosslinks. We estimate a solution to the localization problem
        to built the supporting framework for structures involved, which is non-convex by nature. We vary the starting
        seed to generate multiple supporting framework. The final solution, after registration, is therefore multiple
        conformations. Note, that each iteration takes around 1-1.5 minutes to compute. Thus the user can quickly
        geenrate multiple structures based on the crosslink entries selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also tried by choosing all crosslinks, but it resulted in clashes. This is expected since the magtinude of
        distance between the C-alpha atoms, obtained from experimental crosslink data vary due to the flexibility of the
        side-chain and the backbone chain of the protein. We hypothesize that a fraction of accurate crosslinks lead to
        an accurate structure. We test our algorithm by choosing random subsets of crosslinks. Despite using only a
        fraction of the crosslinks, the end result satisfied a large percentage of the entire set of crosslinks. This
        confirms that IMPROVised can be used for efficient and accurate modeling o fthe three dimensional structrues for
        the protein complexes.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Evaluation
    </h2>
    <p>
        We get different solutions to localization problem for different runs, which results in different registered
        structures. We evaluated these structures based on percentage of correctly satisfied crosslinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall that a crosslink is defined a distance of 30 angstroms between a pair of C-alpha atoms. In reality they
        refer to the distance between the corresponding amino acid residues. Thus a tolerance value of 5 angstrom is
        added to the magnitude of crosslink while evaluating for violations. Once the final structures are modeled, the
        distance between every pair of C-alpha atoms are taken which constitute the crosslinks. If the distance is more
        than 35 angstrom, then it is noted as a violation.
