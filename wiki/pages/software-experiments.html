        We demonstrate the results of our pipeline in two cases: one using
        experimental crosslinking data and the other using synthetic
        crosslinking data.
        In the first case, both protein structures in the complex consist of a
        single chain. In contrast, the second case involves a dimer and a
        monomer forming a complex. The data for the second case was
        synthetically generated, as detailed in the "LCN2-MMP9 Case" section.

    <h1>Ribonuclease Inhibitor Complexed With Ribonuclease A (PDB 1DFJ)</h1>
    <p>
        We are working with the protein identified by PDB ID 1DFJ, which consists of two chains, as illustrated below. Additionally, we have experimental crosslinking data for this protein obtained from 
        <a href="https://github.com/isblab/Integrative_docking_benchmark/tree/main">IMP</a>.

    <p>
        MMP9 has 2 chains and LCN2 has 1 chain. We compare the results obtained
        from IMPROViSeD with the structures for
        the complex downloaded from PDB.

        We do not have experimental crosslinks data available in this case. Hence we have generated
        synthetic crosslinks data using the following algorithm.

    <h1>Running the pipeline</h1>

    <h2>
        Number of crosslinks:
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1dfj: 12 (experimental)</li>
        <li>LCN2-MMP9: 11 (synthetically generated)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        All vs Subset of Crosslinks
    </h2>
    <p>
        We ran our pipeline by choosing random subsets of crosslinks, since we
        are solving a localization problem to form the supporting framework for the two bodies. Note that this being inherently
        non-convex, the solution is not unique
        (depends on random seed). In fact, we use the same to our advantage to
        generate multiple structures for the
        supporting framework by starting with random seeds. Note that the
        execution time is less than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also tried by choosing all crosslinks, but that resulted in more
        clashes. The reason for this is that the
        magnitude of the crosslink is not an absolute value. It is dependent on
        the flexibility of the sidechain and the
        backbone of the protein. Hence, the distance of 30 angstroms varies.
        Moreover, the crosslinks denote the
        distance between the residues, while IMPROViSeD uses the distance
        between the CA atoms. We thus add a tolerance
        value of 5 angstroms to the crosslink distance, while evaluating
        violations.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Evaluation
    </h2>
    <p>
        The results are obtained by running the IMPROViSeD, is tested for:
        <ul>
            <li>Backbone RMSD with known structure in PDB repository: This
                indicates how similar or distict are the
                structures modeled by IMPROViSeD</li>
            <li>Number of crosslink violations to assess the accuracy of
                structure modelling with respect to the experimental
                data.</li>
        </ul>

        We get different solutions to localization problem for different runs,
        which results in different structures
        following the registration step. We evaluated these structures based on
        percentage of correctly satisfied
        crosslinks. We also report the backbone RMSD for each of the cases with
        respect to the structure found in PDB.

        A crosslink is said to be satisfied if crosslink distance is less than
        35 angstroms. In our case crosslink distance
        is between CA atoms between specific residues of 2 chains.
