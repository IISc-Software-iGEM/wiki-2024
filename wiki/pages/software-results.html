            Pseudocode for IMPROViSeD. Modelling three dimensional structures for protein complexes using crosslinking is
            broken down into two steps: Localization and Registration. The subunits are oriented in multiple
            iterations. Each results from a subset of crosslinks, followed by localiztion and registration. The
            iterations proceed in parallel. The structures with low crosslink violations and those that do not have
            clashes make it to as final result.

    <h1>Flip Correction Refinement</h1>
    <p>
        Recall from the "Engineering cycles", that although geometrically mirror images have similar inter-atomic
        distances. They are valid solutions to the registration problem. However, one of the instances do not occur in
        nature. We therefore to verify the same and discard one of the choice of orientations.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was achieved by the flip correction algorithm. The operation was encoded as a reflection across the origin
        in the Ramachandran map, as can be seen in the "Engineering cycles" section. As a result we were successful in
        obtaining the correct orientation for the subunits in the protein complex. Speaking in a general sence, the step
        can be seen as an integral component for modelling protein strcutrues based on the distance constrained obtained
        from experiments and the covalent geometry of the protein.

        Below is the visual representation of the flip correction refinement for 1DFJ. IMPROViSeD was run starting with
        just 6 out of 12 crosslinks. Note that after the flip correction, the three dimensional structure is computed
        even starting with just half the available crosslinks. This also demonstrates the robustness of the IMPROViSeD
        method.

        Result for Ribonuclease Inhibitor Complexed With Ribonuclease A (PDB 1DFJ)
    </h1>
    <p>
        We first present the result obtained for the complex with PDB ID 1DFJ. The experimental data was obtained from
        <a href='https://github.com/isblab/Integrative_docking_benchmark/tree/main'> link </a>.

        Following the localizaton, and having performed the flip correction, as required, the final results for the
        complex with PDB ID 1DFJ, is shown below. The results of multiple iterations was displayed.

        The backbone RMSD after aligning the obtained result with that availabe in PDB is shown underneath each of the
        figure. The number beside represents the number of violated crosslinks out of the total number of crosslinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we were able to achieve multiple orientations, which are distinct from the original structure in PDB,
        but satisfy most of the crosslinks. This not only demonstrates the robustness of the IMPROViSeD method, but also
        highlights its efficiently to model new interfaces.

        Result for Human Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (HNGAL)(PDB ID LCN2)- Hydrolase/Hydrolase Inhibitor
        Complex(PDB ID MMP9)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Next we present the result obtained for the complex with LCN2-MMP9. The crosslinking data was obtained
        artificially, as descibed in the <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/iisc-software/software-experiments">Experiments</a> section.

        Similar to the previous case, we have performed the flip correction, as required, and the final results for the
        complex with LCN2-MMP9, is shown below. The results of multiple iterations was displayed.

        The backbone RMSD after aligning the obtained result with that availabe in PDB is shown underneath each of the
        figure. The number beside represents the number of violated crosslinks out of the total number of crosslinks.

        As before, multple results from IMPROViSeD demonstrate its efficiency to model orientations which differ from
        those available in the public repository (PDB). This is a significant advantage as it allows us to model new
        interfaces.

<h1>
    Analysis of Results
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        IMPROViSeD was able to model the structure of the protein complex, shown here for two instances, both from the
        experimental and artificial data.
    </li>
    <li>
        The time taken for execution is less than 1.5 minutes. This is a significant improvement over the existing
        methods, which take hours. The user certainly has the choice of running molecular dynamics simulations to refine
        the structure further.
    </li>
    <li>
        The method is robust and can model multiple orientations. It is a unique advantage as it allows an end-user to
        model new interfaces. This has the potential to offer insights into the physiological functions of the protein
        complexes.
